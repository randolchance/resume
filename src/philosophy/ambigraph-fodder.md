Blame the leaf for not finding sunlight
Shame the soil for being dry
Tell the rain "now's not the time"
Like a soul with shitty rhymes


To Whom It May Concern,

I have come across your job posting on Indeed.com for the role of Developer. As the Lead Software Engineer for KP9 Interactive and their WorldCAST platform - a cutting edge, UX/UI-focused, WebAR content management system - I believe I can be a great asset to your projects.

With a keen attention to detail and an insatiable will to learn and succeed, I have made a major impact on every company I have worked for, even before starting my career in software by bringing a level of commitment and determination that can be rare to find in this day. Additionally, I take great pride in my ability to understand technical challenges and tailoring my efforts to overcome them in the time afforded. I have a history of finishing tasks ahead of schedule and with high fidelity under challenging time constraints and event with limited knowledge upon undertaking. I look forward to finding the right fit for my expertise with TheAppLabb!

With my science, scientific computing, and software engineering backgrounds front- and back-end, I have little doubt that my skills would benefit your firm. Let's see what we can do together!

we map the human brain with software, we print it out into books, a robot reads the book to make its decisions; is it alive?
we map the brain of God by writing it into a book, a human reads the book to make its decisions; is the person conscious? (Consciencious?)
seems to me we live to make mistakes
which means mistakes are the way, not the obstacle in the way
a skier who looks at trees will run into them. A skier who looks at the space between will see only paths. I heard this the other day

it describes me learning to snowboard and watching my buddies go through the glades and me not being able to do it
i was too concerned about the trees to even risk it
if we exist to err then forgiveness is the natural state
sorry thinking aloud at this point

here's a question
for perhaps the scholars of the bible
is to err to sin? If a man were free of sin would he never err?
i think they would have to be separate things
at the least we know the latter exists
relative to something, anyway

so i was thinking about how it's a bit of a contradiction for the universe to train us evolutionarily to have expectations of outcomes. As we're learning the long way it seems, advertising/marketing is often about "correcting" expectations to align with the salesperson's goals. Most of the time it's to "think X so you buy Y". We've gotten good at the ol' bait and switch, the clickbait. So what can we really do when our ability to expect is cursed. If the world was confused when we were born I would submit we're not really to be held extremely accountable for not unconfusing it in a hurry

anyway the point is that how does one use their mental powers of anticipation when expectation is cursed to try to subvert their conclusions at every step

"the kids today got such useless degrees"
Kids: Why were adults letting kids get useless degrees? Why is it up to a clueless child to figure out before adulthood where the world needs/wants them? lol it's backwards

The crux of my investigation here is: Is there a difference between expectation and anticipation? I think mostly it boils down to the weight placed upon the outcomes? If you anticipate you consider the possibility. If you expect a possibility it means that you've decided that possibility is going to happen, I think?

Is expectation binary, then?

going back to the idea of money self-multiplying; this is the exact reverse operation as the universe makes: More concentrated energy usually leads to greater energy losses. We made a system that literally goes against the nature of the universe, we surrounded it with regulation and armed guards, and so in order to make money multiply we have all the other steps in the banking system, capitalism, to prop it up. We pay taxes to police and the patent system and politicians to keep the rich on top of us because we like the idea of having the chance to one day be rich too, and when that happens we'd love to have all those protections and assistances, wouldn't we? But of course it's rigged so it's just window dressing

what I think people in control had realised at some point is the idea that "convince the mind and the body will follow". Theatre. If you can convince people of X for cheaper than it could cost to do X for real, why not just fake it?

This is the banking system. If I deposit $1000, the bank can use that as collateral to lend 90% of that, and 90% of that, and 90% of that... I just did the math and that's fucking $9k from that $1k. So A thousand dollars deposited is $10k that exists so long as they hold on to $1k of it.
