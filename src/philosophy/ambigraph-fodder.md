Blame the leaf for not finding sunlight
Shame the soil for being dry
Tell the rain "now's not the time"
Like a soul with shitty rhymes


To Whom It May Concern,

I have come across your job posting on Indeed.com for the role of Developer. As the Lead Software Engineer for KP9 Interactive and their WorldCAST platform - a cutting edge, UX/UI-focused, WebAR content management system - I believe I can be a great asset to your projects.

With a keen attention to detail and an insatiable will to learn and succeed, I have made a major impact on every company I have worked for, even before starting my career in software by bringing a level of commitment and determination that can be rare to find in this day. Additionally, I take great pride in my ability to understand technical challenges and tailoring my efforts to overcome them in the time afforded. I have a history of finishing tasks ahead of schedule and with high fidelity under challenging time constraints and event with limited knowledge upon undertaking. I look forward to finding the right fit for my expertise with TheAppLabb!

With my science, scientific computing, and software engineering backgrounds front- and back-end, I have little doubt that my skills would benefit your firm. Let's see what we can do together!

we map the human brain with software, we print it out into books, a robot reads the book to make its decisions; is it alive?
we map the brain of God by writing it into a book, a human reads the book to make its decisions; is the person conscious? (Consciencious?)
seems to me we live to make mistakes
which means mistakes are the way, not the obstacle in the way
a skier who looks at trees will run into them. A skier who looks at the space between will see only paths. I heard this the other day

it describes me learning to snowboard and watching my buddies go through the glades and me not being able to do it
i was too concerned about the trees to even risk it
if we exist to err then forgiveness is the natural state
sorry thinking aloud at this point

here's a question
for perhaps the scholars of the bible
is to err to sin? If a man were free of sin would he never err?
i think they would have to be separate things
at the least we know the latter exists
relative to something, anyway
