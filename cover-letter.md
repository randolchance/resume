Thank you for your time and consideration,

Design Electrical

To Whom It May Concern,

I found the position of Apprentice Electrician on the Job Bank of Canada and got extremely excited. I have found myself looking to switch gears from the life of a software engineer to one that allows me to make something more tangible, more directly useful to my fellow Canadians out here in Bruce and Grey counties. For several years now I have hoped to find a way into an electrical apprenticeship and cutting my tooth with Design Electrical, such a reputable firm, would be an incredible opportunity.

My Electromechanical Engineering Technology diploma and degree in Physics has given me a thorough background in electronic systems at both low and high voltages. Through several co-op positions I received hands-on experience installing and programming machines in industrial applications, e.g., assembly lines, welding robots, PLCs. As a hands-on, technology-minded individual, it was often my solemn duty to repair outlets, lights, and appliances around the homes of friends and family. I also have experience as a draftsperson for HVAC systems and designing circuits, both AC and DC, so reading diagrams comes quite naturally at this point.

While I will always love working with software, I miss tools and physical labour. With Design Electrical, I know I can rapidly gain skills that I feel will always be in demand, and that I can instill in my children one day. There might be younger candidates out there, but my knowledge, world experience, and commitment to my community will always be in demand.

I very much look forward to hearing back from you.

Thank you kindly,

- Daniel Cook


Automha - Kitchener

To Whom It May Concern,

I have found the position of WMS Software Controls Engineer thanks to Indeed.ca and find myself presented with a great opportunity. Recently I have been looking to switch gears from the life of a web-based software engineer to one that allows me to contribute something more tangible, more directly useful to my fellow Canadians. For several years now I have hoped to find a way of blending my more hands-on experience and education as a Electromechanical Engineering Technologist with that of a Lead Software Engineer. I am confident that with Automha that I can make that meaningful contribution, completing projects reliably and with steadfast dedication, additionally leveraging my 6+ years experience in customer service to ensure the best experience for our clients.

My education from Sheridan College and my degree in Honours Physics from the University of Waterloo have given me a thorough background in computational and electrical systems at both low and high voltages, on the factory floor, in the office, or online. Through several co-op positions I received great experience installing and programming machines in industrial applications, e.g., assembly lines, welding robots, PLCs. As a hands-on, technology-minded individual, I also have experience as a draftsperson for HVAC systems and designing circuits, both AC and DC, so reading diagrams comes quite naturally at this point. I have good working experience with Ladder Logic, C++, VisualBasic, C#, and SQL, and can adopt new technologies quickly and thoroughly when required.

Automha would be a fantastic way for me to expand and bridge my existing skillsets, travel and interact with new and lovely Canadians, and make a difference in the country I love. I am very excited by the possibility of relocating back to the Golden Horseshoe area and getting into a more robust and valuable position that I can be proud of working for years to come.

I very much look forward to hearing back from you.

Thank you kindly,

- Daniel Cook
