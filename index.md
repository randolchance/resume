## Relevant Work Experience
### KP9 Interactive (as a Software Engineer) (Oct 2018 - Present)
#### Web Engineer
##### WorldCAST WebAR Studio Content Management System and User Portals
- Designed and created custom CRUD solutions using Vue, Bootstrap, Flask, and MySQL using advanced querying techniques to optimise the handling of large quantities of information
- Co-architected the WorldCAST WebAR ecosystem from the ground up leveraging three.js, CSS3D transforms, custom WebGL shaders, GLB/GLTF, USDZ/Reality, and custom filetypes
- Learned and leveraged countless third-party packages, APIs, and documentations to create novel and proprietary WebAR solutions that work across the majority of devices and platforms
- Researched Computer Vision mathematical foundations and optimisations: Non-linear algebra, Kalman filtering, statistical analysis of multi-variable (4D, non-linear) systems
- Implemented a custom image-recognition solution for unlocking WebAR experiences while considering bandwidth and server limitations and costs and in addition to the standard QR-based triggering mechanism
#### Lead Software Engineer
##### WorldCAST WebAR Studio Content Management System and User Portals
- Created Studio and Portal front- and back-end APIs using PHP, Flask, nginx, and uWSGI, to interface with Stripe, SketchFab, harp.gl, and Open Street Maps APIs
- Maintained good coding standards and practices across all verticals while marshalling a team of as many as eight (8) developers and co-op students
- Coordinated operations and support ticket resolution with enterprise clients across the globe with professionalism and diligence, working any and all hours necessary to satisfy client and company needs
##### HelpCAST WebAR WebRTC Remote Assistance Application
- Conceived of, developed, iterated, and deployed various WebAR implementation strategies for drawing an augmented layer over reality without leveraging the obscene overhead of point-based solutions like SLAM or Visual Object Recognition
- Iterated from procedural-based architecture to OOP-based as project transitioned from demo to live beta
- Accounted for various updates in best-practices and major versions of technologies surrounding WebRTC, WebAR, GLTF/GLB and USDZ/reality

### SNA Automation (as a Technician) (Jan - Aug 2005)
#### Junior Draftsperson and Technician
- Drafted highly-accurate electrical drawings for complex automated processes
- Integrated an updated messaging display system for Labatt's bottling line with a bare-minimum of downtime

### Rumble Automation (as a Technician) (Sep - Dec 2002)
#### Junior Draftsperson and Technician
- Drafted electrical and pneumatic schematics under tight time constraints
- Programmed PLCs and robotic controllers under high-pressure, high-stakes circumstances
